# Build Git from the Bottom Up

This repository contains scripts to build the book [Git from the Bottom Up by John Wigley](https://github.com/jwiegley/git-from-the-bottom-up) in PDF and EPUB formats from the Markdown sources using pandoc running in a docker container.

Simply run `make` to build both PDF and EPUB versions.

Inspired by and building on https://github.com/johnrezzo/git-from-the-bottom-up-ebook/
